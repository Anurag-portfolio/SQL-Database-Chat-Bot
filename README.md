# SQL-Database-Chat-Bot

This project is an AI-powered SQL chatbot built using LangChain, Groq’s LLaMA 3 language model, and a Streamlit interface, designed to allow users to interact with their databases using natural language. It supports both SQLite (with a sample student.db included) and MySQL, offering flexibility for local testing or production-grade setups. The application uses LangChain’s SQL agent to convert user questions into SQL queries, run them against the database, and return the results—all within a live chat experience powered by Groq’s ultra-fast inference. The UI is clean and interactive, and users can select their preferred database, input a Groq API key, and start asking questions like “Show me all students scoring above 90” or “List all classes in Data Science.” The app also includes built-in security warnings against SQL injection and encourages the use of read-only roles for safety. With features like session-based chat memory, a modular setup, and future extensibility for PostgreSQL or visual analytics, this project serves as a powerful demonstration of how large language models can be used to make data querying more intuitive and intelligent.
